# Dentist Office Website Project
This repository contains a Dentist Office Website project created as part of my academic coursework, with real-world application for an existing dental clinic. The project showcases a modern and responsive design, built primarily using static HTML and CSS, while incorporating interactive functionality through JavaScript.

## Features
- 💻 **Static Website**: Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
